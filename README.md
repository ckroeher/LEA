# LEA
The Language for Evolutionary Analysis (LEA) supports the definition of Software Product Line (SPL) verification and analysis approaches. Based on such a definition, the corresponding LEA core will derive possible optimizations to enable an evolutionary verification or analysis: for example, only changed information will be reanalyzed while unchanged information will be reused.

More information and descriptions will follow in future.
